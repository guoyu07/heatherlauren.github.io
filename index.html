    <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
    <p>I &hearts; semantic HTML5, cutting-edge CSS, sensible JavaScript, responsive design and accessibility.</p>

    <p>I'm a junior developer and <a href="http://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders & Coders</a> alumnus, with experience in building websites and web apps for
    a wide audience.</p>

    <p>As a developer, I want to be part of building a more inclusive, fair and sustainable tech industry.
     I write and speak on ethical issues in tech and gaming and am involved with a number
     of tech education and diversity initiatives.</p>

    <h2>Freelance Writing</h2>
    <p>I &hearts; writing about pop culture, the tech industry, and intersectional feminism. If I'm very lucky, I get to write about all three at the same time.</p>
    <p>My work has featured in Book Riot, Bitch Flicks, #FeministFest, and a variety of zines.</p>
