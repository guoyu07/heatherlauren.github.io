Logo for Castle to Castle podcast. The podcast’s name comes from the location of its two hosts, one in Warwick and one in the States, and their respective castles – Warwick castle and the castles found at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

The branding is based around this, with the logo consisting of a silhouette of Warwick castle superimposed on top of the iconic Walt Disney Pictures castle.

As the podcast’s audience is made up of Disney fans, I used a pair of blues which had previously been used in Disney branding and would be instantly recognisable. Finally, the fonts used in the header are simulacrums of those used by Disney and Warwick Castle.
