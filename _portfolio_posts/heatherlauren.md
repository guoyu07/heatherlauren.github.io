A personal blog and portfolio built with Jekyll. Usability was my highest priority: the design
process centred on user stories and testing, and the build on keyboard navigation and screen-reader friendly construction. Documentation for the project can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/heatherlauren/heatherlauren.github.io/wiki).

The design was influenced by two major trends in 2016: [complexion reduction](https://medium.com/swarm-nyc/complexion-reduction-a-new-trend-in-mobile-design-cef033a0b978#.d9e3mxp4o) and use of gradients. As I was increasingly covering tech issues on my blog, I opted for a pink/purple gradient in order to differentiate the site from most tech blogs (which are largely dominated by the use of blues and greens).

The gradient extends to the logotype, designed in distinctive brush font Drop Dead Gorgeous.
