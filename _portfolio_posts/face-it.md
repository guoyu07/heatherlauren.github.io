In-progress MVP mobile app developed as part of the [Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families'](http://www.annafreud.org/) digital accelerator programme for health professionals.

Face It is an game designed for young people with ASD and their families to practice recognising emotions. Users are shown images of faces that have been analysed by Microsoft's [Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api), and asked to determine which of 5 cross-cultural emotions it's displaying. The user's results are compared to those given by Emotion API and tracked over time in data visualisations.

I acted as lead front-end developer and designer on the app. As a result, I worked across the tech stack over the course of the project, in a wide range of roles. Alongside using Bootstrap, Handlebars, jQuery and Sass throughout, I used D3.js to create visualisations of user data, crafted animation using Velocity.js, and worked with Cordova to port Face It to Android.

In my role as designer, meanwhile, I was responsible for the overall look, UI design, and branding for the app. My design choices in the initial sprint were based on existing research on both UI and general design for children on the autistic spectrum; in later sprints, I would adapt the design in response to feedback from test users.
