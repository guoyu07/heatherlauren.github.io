In-progress MVP mobile app developed as part of the [Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families'](http://www.annafreud.org/) digital accelerator programme for health professionals.

Face It is an game designed for young people with ASD and their families to practice recognising emotions. Users are shown images of faces that have been analysed by Microsoft's [Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api), and asked to determine which of 5 cross-cultural emotions it's displaying. The user's results are compared to those given by Emotion API and tracked over time.

As well as working across the project's tech stack (Handlebars, jQuery, and Sass), I took the role of design lead, with my design choices in the initial sprint based on existing research on both UI and general design for children on the autistic spectrum; my choices in later sprints, meanwhile, reflected feedback from test users. As design lead, I also developed the logo and general branding for Face It.
