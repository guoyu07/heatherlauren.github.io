Proposed logo for the Edinburgh community group Friends of Saughton Park. The client wished for the logo to communicate the message ‘Understanding and preserving our past to improve our future’.

I included the sapling to signify the park’s future and its ongoing need to be protected and cared for in the present. The willow tree is used due to its significance in the park’s history and its wide boughs, which allow the community to come together underneath it to preserve its past. Finally, the logo is surrounded by blue, representing the Water of Leith, just as the park itself is ringed by the river.

As it was intended for use by a community group, my foremost aim in designing the logo was for it to be as flexible as possible, maintaining its integrity in a vast range of scales and contexts.
