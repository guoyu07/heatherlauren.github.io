Sonex Euro is a community hub for builders of the Sonex family of homebuilt aircraft in Europe. It had to match the branding of the main site and be accessible for an older audience while retaining a fresh and attractive design. The site is built on a WordPress theme framework and is fully maintainable by a client non-fluent in operating a CMS.

The Sonex in Europe logo uses the colours and typeface of its American counterpart while maintaining a distinct, bold identity. A Sonex aircraft is shown flying over a map of Europe, clearly demonstrating the purpose of the site.

Both the logotype and logomark can work independently, resulting in a flexible and individual design which still ties into the wider Sonex branding.
