Prototype web app produced as part of the [CAST Digital Fellowship](http://www.wearecast.org.uk/), in conjunction with [National Ugly Mugs](https://uknswp.org/um/). Built as part of a four day sprint in React, Redux, and MaterialUI, the prototype aims to demonstrate the flow of a full MVP.

As a passionate advocate for sex worker rights, I was excited to work on this project with one of the UK's leading projects supporting sex worker safety. JustNUM is intended to be a combined task and case manager for the charity's case workers, digitising and streamlining their current workflow, rather than imposing an 'out-of-the-box' system.
