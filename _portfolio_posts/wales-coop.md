Prototype web app produced as part of the [CAST Digital Fellowship](http://www.wearecast.org.uk/), in conjunction with [Wales Co-operative Centre](http://wales.coop/). Developed in Sass and jQuery using agile methodology, the app provides test users with links to a bespoke selection of business resources from the [Social Business Wales website](https://businesswales.gov.wales/socialbusinesswales/).

The resources are filtered dependent on the user's answers to a dynamically animated form; in order to create an engaging experience, said answers are visualised in a doughnut chart generated with [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/); the size of each segment of the doughnut corresponds to the number of questions answered positively in each section.
