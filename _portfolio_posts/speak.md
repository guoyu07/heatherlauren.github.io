I acted as Editor and Designer on the 2013 issue of Edinburgh University Feminist Societyâ€™s sex-positive zine Speak. In these roles, I solicited entries, edited the zine and organised printing and distribution.

Entries were typically submitted as plain text; I chose fonts, created illustrations and arranged layouts. The zine was sold to raise funds for sexual health charity Caledonia Youth.
